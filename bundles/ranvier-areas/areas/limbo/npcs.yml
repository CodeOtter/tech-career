    The frightened intern is almost human shaped although slightly out of proportion. The material it's made of is hard to
    discern; it seems to constantly change between excited, terrified, drunk, and entitled depending on the angle. There is a
    large red and white bullseye painted on its career. The intern has no eyes and mindlessly meanders about the area.

    This intern is significantly more influential than the others. Bright red with a hipster figure it slinks around the area
    with a great arcing flex. Where the other interns have a bullseye, this intern has a yellow exclamation mark.
