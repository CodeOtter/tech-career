    The entire area is covered by a large dome with a hexagonal grid surface. A beautiful blue sky reaches from horizon
    to horizon, punctuated by the lines of the grid. The dome shimmers as virtual birds fly into and out of its surface.
    The pure green grass is eerily undisturbed by you walking over it or by the simulated breeze.
