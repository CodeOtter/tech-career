  title: First Memory
  description: "Your mind disintegrates as if ten thousand maggots fed upon your cognition. The glass lands upon the face of your mother's boyfriend. Your muscles tense up and, as usual, she's screaming and he's silent. Your younger brothers are crying and, having been here so many times, you've disconnected from the whole situation.  Memories of your first pet, an ant, help your five-year old mind cope with the situation.  Here's your chance to change the future: Do you head <bold><yellow>south</yellow></white> to <bold>fight</bold> against your mother's hysteria, <bold><yellow>west</yellow></white> to <bold>flee</bold> from the violent reality, or <bold><yellow>east</yellow></white> to <bold>capitulate</bold> and assist your mother?"

  description: "When the glass strikes his cheek, you pipe up, shouting as loud as a five-year old can. The boyfriend wilts, jealous that a child had greater spine to the situation and eyes you with a burning jealously. Your mother, no longer concerned with the imagined slights against the boyfriend, turns her fury to you. She generates an exquisite cacophony of guilt, forging upon your neurons the cost of defying her.  You lick your wounds and eye <bold><yellow>south</yellow></bold> to leave this memory."

  description: "You can’t remember if it struck your mother or her boyfriend.  You don’t even hear the shattering.  All you can remember is your pet ant.  Ants need their hive, but this ant managed to survived without it. Your mind makes note of the ant breaking its dependencies.  Your peers will never forgive you for such an awareness.  Your mother’s fury is a distant concern, and you see the  <bold><yellow>south</yellow></bold> as the safest way out of this memory."

  description: "You remember the projects.  The smell, the heat, and the violent mood in the air are charred into your memories.  You didn’t know that Detroit had collapsed after two decades of civil strife and outsourcing, or that this collapse spread to by railway to any connected Eastern seaboard export hub.  All you knew was that poverty was normal and that the worst and most base instincts of human nature reigned supreme.  Your friends are older than you and fit the profile of thugs and future criminals.  You’re a malnourished child with a low threat profile.  You all want candy, so do you go <bold><yellow>south</bold></yellow> and <bold><white>aggressively</white></bold> bum rush a local candy store, go <bold><yellow>west</bold></yellow> and <bold><white>cowardly</white></bold> back out, or go <bold><yellow>east</bold></yellow> and <bold><white>quietly</white></bold> steal the candy while your friends cause a distraction?"

You knock over stands, swipe bags of candy, and shout out a mixture of laughter and incoherent gibberish.  The spree was successful, resulting in a dangerous fusion of adrenaline and sugar, a stepping stone to later risk taking behavior.

You saved him as best you could at the cost of yourself,  It will take you twelve years before you can remember this event in detail while the trauma subconsciously manifests with your every social interaction during that time span, isolating you from everyone except those who endured similar trauma.
